# Predicting-Earnings-Manipulation-by-Indian-Firms
In this project, I have to tried to follow up on the events of the case study. The dataset contains financial information of Indian Firms.
Developed various Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Ada Boosting to predict Manipulators.
To overcome class imbalance, I have also applied undersampling. Also did ROC analysis for Logisitc regression model
And then I have presented my recommendations for MCA Technologies.
The case study is in the .pdf file.
